# BedrockSkinUtility

Fabric mod that allows you to view Bedrock skins and capes. Tested on 1.16.4 and 1.16.5. 

Persona/character creator skins are not supported at this time, though there is interest to support this. If you know how the system works, feel free to reach out to me!

Setup:

- Install this mod clientside

- Done!

Thanks to https://github.com/VelvetMC/SimpleCapes for helping me figure out how capes work in Fabric, and for the base of translucent capes.

Thanks to Blockbench for having a convert option to Fabric which greatly helped me get the last puzzle pieces together.
